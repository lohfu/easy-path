# nooks

> A general purpose, middleware based front-end router

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/nooks.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/nooks)

This project was forked and uses lots of internal logic from
[preact-router](https://github.com/developit/preact-router) but
now works very differently. It is more similar to
[page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js).

## Why

When using routers like react-router or preact-router, the route states
are stored outside redux.
